                StayFocusd increases your productivity by limiting the amount of time that you can spend on time-wasting
                websites.
                You sit down at the computer, and you swear you'll be productive. Next thing you know, it's twelve hours
                later. You've checked your email, updated your Facebook status, blown through 200 pages of Reddit, read
                every article in your Twitter feed, looked up your favorite band on Wikipedia, vanity googled yourself,
                cyber-stalked your ex, browsed through all your high-school crushes' Instagram feeds, and lost a week's
                pay playing online poker.

                <p>A mission statement is a short statement of why an organization exists, what its overall goal is,

                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan
                    and
                    commit to achieve. People endeavour to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines. A goal
                    is
                    roughly similar to a purpose or aim, the anticipated result</p>
